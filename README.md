# Library Management Flask Web Application with SQLAlchemy

## SUMMARY
This readme provides an overview of a Flask web application that utilizes SQLAlchemy to manage books, users, and loans. Currently, the application allows you to list all books, users and loans, but it is a work in progress and lacks the ability to display, add, edit, or delete individual items through an html-based webpage, but can be done through Thunder Client with a request.json file in VSCode or any similar tool.
